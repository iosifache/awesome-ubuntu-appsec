# Contribution guide

Please refer to [@sindresorhus's contribution guide](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/contributing.md) for generic instructions about adding new items in Awesome lists. The single difference specific of this list is [the format of the items](#format).

## Format

Each entry of the list should follow the format below:

```markdown
- [<name>](<packages_snap_link>) (<artifact_type>: <description>.
```

The variables in the format and their corresponding meaning are:

- `<artifact_type>`: Artefact type, either "*OS feature*", "*package*" or "*snap*";
- `<description>`: Concise description of the tool;
- `<name>`: The name of the tool; and
- `<packages_snap_link>`: Link to the web manual (starting with `manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages`), `packages.ubuntu.com` (starting with `https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=`) or listing from Snap Store (starting with `https://snapcraft.io`), depending on the artefact type.
